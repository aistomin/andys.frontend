This repository contains the source code of 
the Andy's [website](https://andy-grails.de/). The website contains videos, 
lyrics and music sheets, that are created, re-worked or covered by this amateur artist, who
simply calls himself "Andy" :smiley: 

## Why It Was Created?
The primary goal was to play around with React JS. As a backend developer I have 
not that much experience with the frontend technologies. So, I decided to educate
myself a little bit and learn React JS. That's where the idea of this website came
from.

## Credits
Although I'm the only one contributor here at the moment, I really couldn't build
anything without a community help. I thank all the kind people on the Internet who 
share the information and their work for free: though it's free, it's priceless. 
I'd like to mention some people explicitly:

* [Dave Gray](https://github.com/gitdagray) - programmer, youtuber, teacher and a 
  crazy guy who shares a terrific courses on YouTube. Using those courses I slightly
  improved my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript + I learned how to start with React JS.
* [Soumyajit Behera](https://github.com/soumyajit4419) - GitHub enthusiast from whom I've
  stolen the base of my website. Without his work I would probably have not started the 
  project until this very day.

Thank you all for your work, it's very helpful!!!
